# Rapidfigure
An instagram clone, implemented in Flutter, with a Python backend and a NoSQL database (MongoDB)

This is a variant of the above project, simplified for our course project submission (Principles of Programming Languages).

All the code has been ported to Python solely for this purpose.

We use .csv files to simulate collections in a MongoDB database, and use an APIFetcher python program to act as a drop in replacement for the original MongoDB API.

Features currently added:
- basic API fetching

Planned Features
- Login page 
- User Profile Page 
- User Posts on User Profile page
- A common feed ( consisting of random posts from user's followers)
